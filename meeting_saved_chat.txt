	Can some one tell How to open the  moviesApp.Rproj
07:52:08 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	its already open if you have loaded the posit session
07:52:36 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	if you want to open the text of the file then use file.edit("moviesApp.Rproj")
07:54:50 From Liam To Everyone:

07:55:19 From R Pharma 1 To Everyone:
	For beginners:
	
	https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/
	
	Build a few of the examples there and review the code structure...
	
	From there - read the first 4 chapters here:
	
	https://mastering-shiny.org/
	
	Take a look at the Shiny UI Editor - nice tool to help you build shiny apps
	shinyuieditor::launch_editor(app_loc = "new-app/")
	
	Then review the content here: https://rpharma.shinyprod.com/
	
	learn about publishing to the web etc.

08:22:33 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	maybe a dumb question, but how do you determine when to explicitly call the package name with xx :: vs when to use the @import ?
08:22:38 From Michelle Ha To Everyone:
	Joining late. Could you please post the link for Rstudio again?
08:24:19 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	from a "performance" perspective do you feel like one slows down vs the other or when you want to "slim" down your app is there good areas to look other than this?
08:25:05 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	ok you answered my second question with that lol
08:26:01 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	right! so when possible, do you feel like base r is preferred over package dependent development?
08:27:23 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	so again a threshold that comes from experience I am guessing, or is there a good rule of thumb?
08:30:24 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	last question I promise, do you think it would be a good idea to take the function from a package manually and bring it into the development workflow for your package vs explicitly calling the function from the source package?

09:08:00 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	from a beginner perspective, would it be the best use of time to learn one framework over another in terms of design to best prepare an app as it becomes more complicated or how would you suggest to best future proof an app?
09:08:38 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	DJ Phil got the beats
09:10:46 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	do you have an order of learning when it comes to R Shiny vs R Packages? like learning one before another would be more helpful or less confusing over another?

09:52:59 From Karan Shah To Everyone:
	not sure if you already answered this (asking as we are nearing the end), but someone in the beginning asked when we were talking about user base r whenever possible, what are your thoughts about copy-pasting a function from other packages instead of loading entire package? I think area of concern for me would potentially not giving credit to original developer
09:55:09 From Jared Woolfolk To Everyone:
	Replying to "not sure if you alre..."
	
	@Karan Shah totally agree and where I was coming from, I think my question also surrounds the need for dependability and it NOT to change with future updates, essentially ensuring your application works regardless of future updates to dependency packages.
